    """
        Calculates the collision response between a sphere and a plane.

        Note that the plane does not have a position or orientation. 
        This is because the plane is infinite and it is only defined by its normal and 
        distance to the origin (the offset). The normal is a unit vector that points in 
        the direction of the normal of the plane. 
        The distance is the distance from the origin to the plane along the normal vector.


        Currently the funtion only applies to objects above the plane (in the direction of the normal)
